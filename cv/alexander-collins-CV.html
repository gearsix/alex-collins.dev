        <h3>Summary</h3>
        
        <!-- TODO trim -->
        <p>I'm a software engineer who enjoys solving real-world problems, working out clean algorithms and solving complex problems with simple solutions. Always motivated when learning something new or solving problems to benefit others or myself. While rarely the loudest member of a group, I always voice concerns, ideas and offer a pragmatic perspective. Aside from technical skills, I thrive when challenged with a problem that requires a lot of thought and am always trying to plan ahead.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, my interests include programming, writing and some arts 
        - I'm always looking to try new things. I love going to music concerts, video games and hiking when I need to wind down.</p>
